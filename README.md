# Vector Field Visualization

This project demonstrates how to visualize a 3D vector field and its curl using Python's Matplotlib library. The vector field of interest is defined as \(F(x,y,z) = (y^2-z^2)\mathbf{i} + (2xz +3)\mathbf{j} + (2xy-4z)\mathbf{k}\), which represents a mathematical model that can describe phenomena such as fluid flow or electromagnetic fields.

## Vector Field

The vector field \(F(x,y,z)\) is visualized in a 3D space. The components of the field are calculated as follows:

- \(F_x = y^2 - z^2\)
- \(F_y = 2xz + 3\)
- \(F_z = 2xy - 4z\)

These components are used to plot vectors originating from a grid of points within the 3D space, providing a visual representation of the field's direction and magnitude at each point.

## Curl of the Vector Field

The curl of the vector field is also visualized, representing the rotational tendency or the 'curl' at each point in the field. The curl is computed as:

- \(Curl F_x = 0\) (since the curl in the x-direction is 0)
- \(Curl F_y = -2z - 2y\)
- \(Curl F_z = 2z - 2y\)

## Visualization

Both the vector field and its curl are plotted with colors based on their magnitude, providing a deeper insight into the field's behavior across the 3D space. The magnitude of the vectors is used to color the arrows, creating a visually informative plot that highlights areas of high and low intensity within the field.

## Requirements

To run the visualization code, you will need:

- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

Ensure you have these installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
